Syntax for interface:


public interface Action {
    public void play();

    public void play(Toy toy);

}

Then in class call this: implements Action

Because of this, this works:

Action[] animals = new Action[]{coco, max, rabbit, robot};
        for (Action friend : animals) {
            friend.play(legoCar);
        }

//All objects are of type action because the share this interface

Syntax for class inheritance:

public abstract class Animal implements Action {

    // These variables are going to be shared across all classes that have "extends Animal"
    protected String name;
    protected int age;

    public Animal(String name, int age) {
        this.name = name;
        this.age = age;
    }


}

Then in subclasses call this: extends Animal
